Known for their intelligence and complex social structures, elephants form deep family bonds that can last a lifetime. These gentle giants possess remarkable memory capabilities and demonstrate emotional behaviors like mourning their dead. Their distinctive trunks, containing over 40,000 muscles, serve multiple purposes from gathering food to expressing affection.\\n\\nThe arctic fox is a fascinating animal that has adapted perfectly to life in the extreme cold. During winter, its thick white fur provides both insulation and camouflage in the snowy landscape, while in summer its coat turns brownish-gray to blend with the tundra. These resourceful predators can survive temperatures as low as -50\u00b0C (-58\u00b0F) and will travel vast distances across the Arctic ice in search of food, often following polar bears to scavenge their leftovers.\\n\\nThe octopus stands out as one of the ocean's most intelligent invertebrates. With nine brains (one central brain and eight additional ones in each arm), these cephalopods can solve complex puzzles, open jars, and even use tools. Their remarkable ability to change both color and texture allows them to perfectly mimic their surroundings, making them masters of disguise. Despite their impressive capabilities, most octopus species live only 1-2 years, making their intelligence even more remarkable given their short lifespan.\"}]", "response_schema": "{'properties': {'answer': {'title': 'Answer', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['answer'], 'title': 'Answer', 'type': 'object'}", "mode": "'json'", "**": "{'seed': 42, 'stop': None}"}, "time": 1746014657.181783}
